    # The `download_endpoint` plugin provides a Rack endpoint for downloading
    # uploaded files from specified storages. This can be useful when files
    # from your storage isn't accessible over URL (e.g. database storages) or
    # if you want to authenticate your downloads. It requires the [Roda] gem.
    #
    # You can configure the plugin with the path prefix which the endpoint will
    # be mounted on.
    #
    #     plugin :download_endpoint, prefix: "attachments"
    #
    # The endpoint should then be mounted on the specified prefix:
    #
    #     # config.ru (Rack)
    #     map "/attachments" do
    #       run Shrine.download_endpoint
    #     end
    #
    #     # OR
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb (Rails)
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       mount Shrine.download_endpoint => "/attachments"
    #     end
    #
    # Any uploaded file can be downloaded through this endpoint. When a file is
    # requested, its content will be efficiently streamed from the storage into
    # the response body.
    #
    # Links to the download endpoint are generated by calling
    # `UploadedFile#download_url` instead of the usual `UploadedFile#url`.
    #
    #     uploaded_file.download_url #=> "/attachments/eyJpZCI6ImFkdzlyeTM5ODJpandoYWla"
    #
    # Note that streaming the file through your app might impact the request
    # throughput of your app, depending on which web server is used. It's
    # recommended to either configure a CDN to serve these files:
    #
    #     plugin :download_endpoint, host: "http://abc123.cloudfront.net"
    #
    # or configure the endpoint to redirect to the direct file URL:
    #
    #     plugin :download_endpoint, redirect: true
    #     # or
    #     plugin :download_endpoint, redirect: -> (uploaded_file, request) do
    #       # return URL which the request will redirect to
    #     end
    #
    # Alternatively, you can stream files yourself from your controller using
    # the `rack_response` plugin, which this plugin uses internally.
    #
