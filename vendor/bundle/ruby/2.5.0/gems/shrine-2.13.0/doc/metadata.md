# Extracting Metadata

Before a file is uploaded, Shrine automatically extracts metadata from it, and
stores them in the `Shrine::UploadedFile` object. By default it extracts
`size`, `filename` and `mime_type`.

```rb
uploaded_file = uploader.upload(file)
uploaded_file.metadata #=>
# {
#   "size" => 345993,
#   "filename" => "matrix.mp4",
#   "mime_type" => "video/mp4",
# }
```

Under the hood `Shrine#extract_metadata` is called, which you can also use
directly to extract metadata from any IO object.

```rb
uploader.extract_metadata(io) #=>
# {
#   "size" => 345993,
#   "filename" => "matrix.mp4",
#   "mime_type" => "video/mp4",
# }
```

Note that you can also manually add or override metadata on upload by passing
the `:metadata` option to `Shrine#upload`:

```rb
uploaded_file = uploader.upload(file, metadata: { "filename" => "Matrix[1999].mp4", "foo" => "bar" })
uploaded_file.original_filename #=> "Matrix[1999].mp4"
uploaded_file.metadata["foo"]   #=> "bar"
```

## MIME type

By default, the `mime_type` metadata will be copied over from the
`#content_type` attribute of the input file, if present. However, since
`#content_type` value comes from the `Content-Type` header of the upload
request, it's *not guaranteed* to hold the actual MIME type of the file (browser
determines this header based on file extension). Moreover, only
`ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile` and `Shrine::Plugins::RackFile::UploadedFile`
objects have `#content_type` defined, so when uploading simple file objects
`mime_type` will be nil. That makes relying on `#content_type` both a security
risk and limiting.

To remedy that, Shrine comes with a `determine_mime_type` plugin which is able
to extract the MIME type from IO *content*. When you load it, the `mime_type`
plugin will now be determined using the UNIX [`file`] command.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :determine_mime_type
```
```rb
uploaded_file = uploader.upload StringIO.new("<?php ... ?>")
uploaded_file.mime_type #=> "text/x-php"
```

The `file` command won't correctly determine the MIME type in all cases, that's
why the `determine_mime_type` plugin comes with different MIME type analyzers.
So, instead of the `file` command you can use gems like [MimeMagic] or
[Marcel], as well as mix-and-match the analyzers to suit your needs. See the
plugin documentation for more details.

## Image Dimensions

Shrine comes with a `store_dimensions` plugin for extracting image dimensions.
It adds `width` and `height` metadata values, and also adds `#width`,
`#height`, and `#dimensions` methods to the `Shrine::UploadedFile` object. By
default, the plugin uses [FastImage] to analyze dimensions, but you can also
have it use [MiniMagick] or [ruby-vips]:

```rb
Shrine.plugin :store_dimensions, analyzer: :mini_magick
```
```rb
uploaded_file = uploader.upload(image)
uploaded_file.metadata["width"]  #=> 1600
uploaded_file.metadata["height"] #=> 900

# convenience methods
uploaded_file.width      #=> 1600
uploaded_file.height     #=> 900
uploaded_file.dimensions #=> [1600, 900]
```

## Custom metadata

In addition to the built-in metadata, Shrine allows you to extract and store
any custom metadata, using the `add_metadata` plugin (which extends
`Shrine#extract_metadata`). For example, you might want to extract EXIF data
from images:

```rb
require "mini_magick"

class ImageUploader < Shrine
  plugin :add_metadata

  add_metadata :exif do |io|
    Shrine.with_file(io) do |file|
      begin
        MiniMagick::Image.new(file.path).exif
      rescue MiniMagick::Error
        # not a valid image
      end
    end
  end
end
```
```rb
uploaded_file = uploader.upload(image)
uploaded_file.metadata["exif"] #=> {...}
uploaded_file.exif             #=> {...}
```

Or, if you're uploading videos, you might want to extract some video-specific
meatadata:

```rb
require "streamio-ffmpeg"

class VideoUploader < Shrine
  plugin :add_metadata

  add_metadata do |io, context|
    movie = Shrine.with_file(io) { |file| FFMPEG::Movie.new(file.path) }

    { "duration"   => movie.duration,
      "bitrate"    => movie.bitrate,
      "resolution" => movie.resolution,
      "frame_rate" => movie.frame_rate }
  end
end
```
```rb
uploaded_file = uploader.upload(video)
uploaded_file.metadata #=>
# {
#   ...
#   "duration" => 7.5,
#   "bitrate" => 481,
#   "resolution" => "640x480",
#   "frame_rate" => 16.72
# }
```

The yielded `io` object will not always be an object that responds to `#path`.
If you're using the `data_uri` plugin, the `io` will be a `StringIO` wrapper.
When the `restore_cached_data` plugin is loaded, any assigned cached file will
get their metadata extracted, and `io` will be a `Shrine::UploadedFile` object.
If you're using a metadata analyzer that requires the source file to be on
disk, you can use `Shrine.with_file` to ensure you have a file object.

Also, be aware that metadata is extracted before file validation, so you'll
need to handle the cases where the file is not of expected type.

## Metadata columns

If you want to write any of the metadata values into a separate database column
on the record, you can use the `metadata_attributes` plugin.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :metadata_attributes, :mime_type => :type
```
```rb
photo = Photo.new(image: file)
photo.image_type #=> "image/jpeg"
```

## Direct uploads

When attaching files that were uploaded directly to the cloud or a [tus
server], Shrine won't automatically extract metadata from them, instead it will
copy any existing metadata that was set on the client side. The reason why this
is the default behaviour is because extracting the metadata would require (at
least partially) retrieving file content from the storage, which could
potentially be expensive depending on the storage and the type of metadata
being extracted.

If you're just attaching files uploaded directly to local disk, there wouldn't
be any additional performance penalty for extracting metadata. However, if
you're attaching files uploaded directly to a cloud service like S3, retrieving
file content for metadata extraction would require an HTTP download. If you're
using just the `determine_mime_type` plugin, only a small portion of the file
will be downloaded, so the performance impact might not be so big. But in other
cases you might have to download the whole file.

There are two ways of extracting metadata from directly uploaded files. If you
want metadata to be automatically extracted on assignment (which is useful if
you want to validate the extracted metadata or have it immediately available),
you can load the `restore_cached_data` plugin:

```rb
Shrine.plugin :restore_cached_data # automatically extract metadata from cached files on assingment
```
```rb
photo.image = '{"id":"ks9elsd.jpg","storage":"cache","metadata":{}}' # metadata is extracted
photo.image.metadata #=>
# {
#   "size" => 4593484,
#   "filename" => "nature.jpg",
#   "mime_type" => "image/jpeg"
# }
```

On the other hand, if you're using backgrounding, you can extract metadata
during background promotion using the `refresh_metadata` plugin (which the
`restore_cached_data` plugin uses internally):

```rb
Shrine.plugin :refresh_metadata
```
```rb
class MyUploader < Shrine
  plugin :processing

  # this will be called in the background if using backgrounding plugin
  process(:store) do |io, context|
    io.refresh_metadata! # extracts metadata and updates `io.metadata`
    io
  end
end
```

If you have metadata that is cheap to extract in the foreground, but also have
additional metadata that can be extracted asynchronously, you can combine the
two approaches. For example, if you're attaching video files, you might want to
extract MIME type upfront and video-specific metadata in a background job, which
can be done as follows (provided that `backgrounding` plugin is used):

```rb
Shrine.plugin :restore_cached_data
```
```rb
class MyUploader < Shrine
  plugin :determine_mime_type # this will be called in the foreground
  plugin :processing

  # this will be called in the background if using backgrounding plugin
  process(:store) do |io, context|
    additional_metadata = io.download do |file|
      # example of metadata extraction
      movie = FFMPEG::Movie.new(file.path) # uses the streamio-ffmpeg gem

      { "duration"   => movie.duration,
        "bitrate"    => movie.bitrate,
        "resolution" => movie.resolution,
        "frame_rate" => movie.frame_rate }
    end

    io.metadata.merge!(additional_metadata)

    io
  end
end
```
