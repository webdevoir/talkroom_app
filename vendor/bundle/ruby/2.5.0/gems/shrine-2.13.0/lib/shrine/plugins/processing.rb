    # Shrine uploaders can define the `#process` method, which will get called
    # whenever a file is uploaded. It is given the original file, and is
    # expected to return the processed files.
    #
    #     def process(io, context)
    #       # you can process the original file `io` and return processed file(s)
    #     end
    #
    # However, when handling files as attachments, the same file is uploaded
    # to temporary and permanent storage. Since we only want to apply the same
    # processing once, we need to branch based on the context.
    #
    #     def process(io, context)
    #       if context[:action] == :store # promote phase
    #         # ...
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # The `processing` plugin simplifies this by allowing us to declaratively
    # define file processing for specified actions.
    #
    #     plugin :processing
    #
    #     process(:store) do |io, context|

    # An example of resizing an image using the [image_processing] library:
    #
    #     require "image_processing/mini_magick"
    #
    #     process(:store) do |io, context|
    #       io.download do |original|
    #         ImageProcessing::MiniMagick
    #           .source(original)
    #           .resize_to_limit!(800, 800)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # The declarations are additive and inheritable, so for the same action you
    # can declare multiple blocks, and they will be performed in the same order,
    # with output from previous block being the input to next.
    #
    # ## Manually Run Processing
    #
    # You can manually trigger the defined processing via the uploader by calling
    # `#upload` or `#process` and setting `:action` to the name of your processing block:
    #
    #     uploader.upload(file, action: :store)  # process and upload
    #     uploader.process(file, action: :store) # only process
    #
    # If you want the result of processing to be multiple files, use the
    # `versions` plugin.
