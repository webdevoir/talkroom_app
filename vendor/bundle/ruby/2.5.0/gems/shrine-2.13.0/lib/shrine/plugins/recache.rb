    # The `recache` plugin allows you to process your attachment after
    # validations succeed, but before the attachment is promoted. This is
    # useful for example when you want to generate some versions upfront (so
    # the user immediately sees them) and other versions you want to generate
    # in the promotion phase in a background job.

    #     plugin :recache

    #     process(:recache) do |io, context|
    #       # perform cheap processing
    #     end
    #
    #     process(:store) do |io, context|
    #       # perform more expensive processing
    #     end
    #
    # Recaching will be automatically triggered in a "before save" callback,
    # but if you're using the attacher directly, you can call it manually:
    #
    #     attacher.recache if attacher.changed?
