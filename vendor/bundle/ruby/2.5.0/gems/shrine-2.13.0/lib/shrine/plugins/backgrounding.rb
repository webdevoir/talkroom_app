  module Plugins
    # The `backgrounding` plugin enables you to move promoting and deleting of
    # files from record's lifecycle into background jobs. This is especially
    # useful if you're doing processing and/or you're storing files on an
    # external storage service.
    #
    # The plugin provides `Attacher.promote` and `Attacher.delete` methods,
    # which allow you to hook up to promoting and deleting and spawn background
    # jobs, by passing a block.
    #
    #     Shrine.plugin :backgrounding
    #
    #     # makes all uploaders use background jobs
    #     Shrine::Attacher.promote { |data| PromoteJob.perform_async(data) }
    #     Shrine::Attacher.delete { |data| DeleteJob.perform_async(data) }
    #
    # If you don't want to apply backgrounding for all uploaders, you can
    # declare the hooks only for specific uploaders (in this case it's still
    # recommended to keep the plugin loaded globally).
    #
    #     class MyUploader < Shrine
    #       # makes this uploader use background jobs
    #       Attacher.promote { |data| PromoteJob.perform_async(data) }
    #       Attacher.delete { |data| DeleteJob.perform_async(data) }
    #     end
    #
    # The yielded `data` variable is a serializable hash containing all context
    # needed for promotion/deletion. Now you just need to declare the job
    # classes, and inside them call `Attacher.promote` or `Attacher.delete`,
    # this time with the received data.
    #
    #     class PromoteJob
    #       include Sidekiq::Worker
    #       def perform(data)
    #         Shrine::Attacher.promote(data)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    #     class DeleteJob
    #       include Sidekiq::Worker
    #       def perform(data)
    #         Shrine::Attacher.delete(data)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # This example used Sidekiq, but obviously you could just as well use
    # any other backgrounding library. This setup will be applied globally for
    # all uploaders.
    #
    # If you're generating versions, and you want to process some versions in
    # the foreground before kicking off a background job, you can use the
    # `recache` plugin.
    #
    # In your application you can use `Attacher#cached?` and `Attacher#stored?`
    # to differentiate between your background job being in progress and
    # having completed.
    #
    #     if user.avatar_attacher.cached? # background job is still in progress
    #       # ...
    #     elsif user.avatar_attacher.stored? # background job has finished
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #
    # ## `Attacher.promote` and `Attacher.delete`
    #
    # In background jobs, `Attacher.promote` and `Attacher.delete` will resolve
    # all necessary objects, and do the promotion/deletion. If
    # `Attacher.find_record` is defined (which comes with ORM plugins), model
    # instances will be treated as database records, with the `#id` attribute
    # assumed to represent the primary key. Then promotion will have the
    # following behaviour:
    #
    # 1. retrieves the database record
    #     * if record is not found, it finishes
    #     * if record is found but attachment has changed, it finishes
    # 2. uploads cached file to permanent storage
    # 3. reloads the database record
    #     * if record is not found, it deletes the promoted files and finishes
    #     * if record is found but attachment has changed, it deletes the promoted files and finishes
    # 4. updates the record with the promoted files
    #
    # Both `Attacher.promote` and `Attacher.delete` return a `Shrine::Attacher`
    # instance (if the action hasn't aborted), so you can use it to perform
    # additional tasks:
    #
    #     def perform(data)
    #       attacher = Shrine::Attacher.promote(data)
    #       attacher.record.update(published: true) if attacher && attacher.record.is_a?(Post)
    #     end
    #
    # ### Plain models
    #
    # You can also do backgrounding with plain models which don't represent
    # database records; the plugin will use that mode if `Attacher.find_record`
    # is not defined. In that case promotion will have the following behaviour:
    #
    # 1. instantiates the model
    # 2. uploads cached file to permanent storage
    # 3. writes promoted files to the model instance
    #
    # You can then retrieve the promoted files via the attacher object that
    # `Attacher.promote` returns, and do any additional tasks if you need to.
    #
    # ## `Attacher#_promote` and `Attacher#_delete`
    #
    # The plugin modifies `Attacher#_promote` and `Attacher#_delete` to call
    # the registered blocks with serializable attacher data, and these methods
    # are internally called by the attacher. `Attacher#promote` and
    # `Attacher#delete!` remain synchronous.
    #
    #     # asynchronous (spawn background jobs)
    #     attacher._promote
    #     attacher._delete(attachment)
    #
    #     # synchronous
    #     attacher.promote
    #     attacher.delete!(attachment)
    #
    # ## `Attacher.dump` and `Attacher.load`
    #
    # The plugin adds `Attacher.dump` and `Attacher.load` methods for
    # serializing attacher object and loading it back up. You can use them to
    # spawn background jobs for custom tasks.
    #
    #     data = Shrine::Attacher.dump(attacher)
    #     SomethingJob.perform_async(data)
    #
    #     # ...
    #
    #     class SomethingJob
    #       def perform(data)
    #         attacher = Shrine::Attacher.load(data)
    #         # ...
    #       end
    #     end
