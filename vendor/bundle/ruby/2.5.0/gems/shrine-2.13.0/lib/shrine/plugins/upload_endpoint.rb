    # The `upload_endpoint` plugin provides a Rack endpoint which accepts file
    # uploads and forwards them to specified storage. On the client side it's
    # recommended to use [Uppy] for asynchronous uploads.
    #
    #     plugin :upload_endpoint
    #
    # The plugin adds a `Shrine.upload_endpoint` method which, given a storage
    # identifier, returns a Rack application that accepts multipart POST
    # requests, and uploads received files to the specified storage. You can
    # run this Rack application inside your app:
    #
    #     # config.ru (Rack)
    #     map "/images/upload" do
    #       run ImageUploader.upload_endpoint(:cache)
    #     end
    #
    #     # OR
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb (Rails)
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       mount ImageUploader.upload_endpoint(:cache) => "/images/upload"
    #     end
    #
    # Asynchronous upload is typically meant to replace the caching phase in
    # the default synchronous workflow, so we want the uploads to go to
    # temporary (`:cache`) storage.
    #
    # The above will create a `POST /images/upload` endpoint, which uploads the
    # file received in the `file` param using `ImageUploader`, and returns a
    # JSON representation of the uploaded file.
    #
    #     # POST /images/upload
    #     {
    #       "id": "43kewit94.jpg",
    #       "storage": "cache",
    #       "metadata": {
    #         "size": 384393,
    #         "filename": "nature.jpg",
    #         "mime_type": "image/jpeg"
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # This JSON string can now be assigned to an attachment attribute instead
    # of a raw file. In a form it can be written to a hidden attachment field,
    # and then it can be assigned as the attachment.
    #
    # ## Limiting filesize
    #
    # It's good practice to limit the accepted filesize of uploaded files. You
    # can do that with the `:max_size` option:
    #
    #     plugin :upload_endpoint, max_size: 20*1024*1024 # 20 MB
    #
    # If the uploaded file is larger than the specified value, a `413 Payload
    # Too Large` response will be returned.
    #
    # ## Checksum
    #
    # If you want the upload endpoint to verify the integrity of the uploaded
    # file, you can include the `Content-MD5` header in the request filled with
    # the base64-encoded MD5 hash of the file that was calculated prior to the
    # upload, and the endpoint will automatically use it to verify the uploaded
    # data.
    #
    # If the checksums don't match, a `460 Checksum Mismatch` response is
    # returned.
    #
    # ## Context
    #
    # The upload context will *not* contain `:record` and `:name` values, as
    # the upload happens independently of a database record. The endpoint will
    # send the following upload context:
    #
    # * `:action` - holds the value `:upload`
    # * `:request` - holds an instance of `Rack::Request`
    #
    # You can update the upload context via `:upload_context`:
    #
    #     plugin :upload_endpoint, upload_context: -> (request) do
    #       { location: "my-location" }
    #     end
    #
    # ## Upload
    #
    # You can also customize the upload itself via the `:upload` option:
    #
    #     plugin :upload_endpoint, upload: -> (io, context, request) do
    #       Shrine.new(:cache).upload(io, context)
    #     end
    #
    # ## Response
    #
    # The response returned by the endpoint can be customized via the
    # `:rack_response` option:
    #
    #     plugin :upload_endpoint, rack_response: -> (uploaded_file, request) do
    #       body = { data: uploaded_file.data, url: uploaded_file.url }.to_json
    #       [201, { "Content-Type" => "application/json" }, [body]]
    #     end
    #
    # ## Ad-hoc options
    #
    # You can override any of the options above when creating the endpoint:
    #
    #     Shrine.upload_endpoint(:cache, max_size: 20*1024*1024)
    #
    # [Uppy]: https://uppy.io
